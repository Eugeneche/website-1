  "about_text": "I invite you to discover what lies behind each frame and every project I've created. I am a videographer who firmly believes that every project starts from the heart, with the unique stories of people who have written their love stories. My mission is to capture emotions and immortalize them through my camera. What I do makes me a happy person. People are my main source of inspiration. Thanks to videography, I have become a witness to love stories in the Czech Republic and Ukraine, stories that have been experienced and transformed into films. I feel a responsibility to convey honest emotions and the sensuality of every second. I especially enjoy capturing the sacred moments of weddings. In the presence of the Lord, people's faces become radiant and pure, expressing true love, which I preserve for them. I love to see and capture what underlies every love story that later becomes a screenplay. These are stories that will stay in families' memories for a lifetime and be passed down to future generations.",
